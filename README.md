jQuery DC Meetups
=================

This is just my little repo for keep track of files that I'm using for jquery
meetups. I'll try to folder it off by date to make things easier.

Please fork and push back if you have demos and things to contribute!

Installing this repo
--------------------
This repo uses submodules for jquery and for others' presentations. If you're cloning for the first time, use:
    git clone --recursive http://github.com/elgreg/jquery_meetups.git

If you've already cloned it, you can get the latest submodules by using
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Future Presentation Ideas
-------------------------
* jQuery templating plugin
* jQuery UI themeing
* jQuery mobile
* Testing in javascript (jasmine? junit?)
* canvas and canvas-wrappers ([canto-js](http://code.google.com/p/canto-js/), [fabric.js](https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js), [artisanjs](http://artisanjs.com/))
